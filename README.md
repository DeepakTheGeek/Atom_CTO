Hey there, Deepak here. In this application Angular is used as front end and ASP.Net Core Web API is used as back end. 
For Angular version 10 is used and for API, version 3.1 is used. 

Few point before running the application:
-----------------------------------------
1. In API, local sql server is used to store location data,  so please make sure to change the connection string accordingly.
2. To keep upto date with the migrations, please run the script file available in Helper Files folder.
3. Before building the angular application, make sure to install all the dependecies using 'npm install'.
